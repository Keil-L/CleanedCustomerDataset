# CleanedCustomerDataset
The CleanedCustomerDataset SQL script represents a comprehensive approach to data cleansing, tailored specifically for enhancing the quality of customer information. This meticulously crafted script not only corrects and standardizes data but also ensures its reliability and usability for analytical purposes.

In the first phase of the cleaning process, the script addresses data validity by removing records with invalid or null email addresses. This step is crucial as email addresses are often primary communication links with customers and their integrity is vital for any customer-related operations. Following this, the script standardizes phone numbers into a uniform format, catering to consistency across the dataset. This standardization is essential for seamless integration with systems that require a specific phone number format.

The subsequent steps involve trimming unnecessary spaces from names and addresses and updating null values in the registration dates. These refinements eliminate minor inconsistencies that can lead to major discrepancies in data analytics. The final and significant phase of deduplication removes duplicate entries based on email addresses, retaining only the most recent records. This step is pivotal in maintaining the uniqueness of each customer record, thereby ensuring the dataset's integrity.

Overall, the CleanedCustomerDataset SQL script transforms raw customer data into a polished, accurate, and valuable resource, paving the way for insightful data analysis and informed decision-making.
